# Network Delay Time 

Use Dijkstra algorithm to traversal whole nodes in the graph, and just find the node which has the largest time-spending

**Note**

* Use `defaultdict` in `collections`
    * Much simpler and readable than `dict.setdefault()`
    * [Ref](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#defaultdict-examples)
